| Integration Execution & Scalability | When executed, workflows are queued, and then allocated to an execution environment when one is available.  Paid customers have dedicated queues and their own execution pool, where as free customers share the queue/execution pool.  If the execution pool becomes exhausted, whilst we do scale up, you may see periods where a short wait may occur for an exection environment to become available or for the additional nodes to join the pool | FlowServices run in a multi-threaded server and immediately execute synchronously.  Flow services execute straight through and therefore provide significantly more performance than a workflow.  Multiple engines, also with scaling service the FlowService executions.                                                                                                                 |
| Maximum Asynchronous Execution Time | Asynchronous Workflows can run for a maximum of 30 minutes, with the maximum duration being configurable for each Workflow. Should there be a need for Workflowsto run for longer than 30 minutes will need to be executed across multiple engines, chained via invocations or messaging                                                                                                                                                              | A FlowService has no maximum execution time and can run for as long as is needed, however FlowServices are typically synchronous that can facilitate Asynchronous needs, via a HTTP call, or through the use of messaging.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Maximum Synchronous Execution Time  | Synchronous Workflows are those run through webHooks or via API calls with a return sync response.  These maintain an open connection between the invoker and the server until the workflow has fininshed or a timeout is reached.  This timeout can be from the workflow engine, or from the ingress layer and the maximum possible execution time is 3Â minutes.                                                                                    | FlowServices are syncrhonous integrations and as they are running in a multithreaded and scaled engine, these can run indefintely.  To avoid thread starvation, loops which could run indefinitely have a timeout set on them which cannot be altered.  This value is defaulted currently to 6 hours and cannot be changed.  These loops include repeat for count, while/do and do/until. |
| RAM / Available Memory              | Workflows for paid customers execute in a 1GB execution environment.  Free customers execute in a 256MB environment.  You can see the memory size in the debug pane when you manually run a workflow in the editor. As each action in a workflow is additative, and actions cannot be dropped, the memory can be quickly exhausted when consuming large (typically file based payloads)                                                               | The integration servers have ~14GB of RAM available to them, which along with streaming and FlatFile parsing capabilities resulting in ability to support considerably larger file sizes when an integration is implemented correctly.                                                                                                                                                    |
